The *.0  files are input Spparks files.

Execute the follwing command to run the Spparks input files (*.0)
	$ mpirun -np 1 spk_redsky < *.0

spk_redsky is an executable file generated while building Spparks. The instruction for building spparks executable can be found at the website,  https://spparks.github.io/doc/Section_start.html


The source codes for Spparks to model NK signaling for different models and NK cell signaling are attached in the respective folders.

	1. model1_act_sig_spparks_src_codes (source codes to stimulate Model 1 in presence of activating ligands; the rates are estimated by PSO)

	2. model2_act_sig_spparks_src_codes (source codes to stimulate Model 2 in presence of activating ligands; the rates are estimated by PSO)

	3. model3_act_sig_spparks_src_codes (source codes to stimulate Model 3 in presence of activating ligands; the rates are estimated by PSO)

	4. model2_inb_sig_spparks_src_codes (source codes to stimulate Model 2 in presence of both activating and inhibitory ligands (inhibitory ligands are distributed heterogeneously e.g.ring); the rates are estimated by PSO)

	5. model3_inb_sig_spparks_src_codes (source codes to stimulate Model 3 in presence of both activating and inhibitory ligands (inhibitory ligands are distributed heterogeneously e.g.ring); the rates are estimated by PSO)
